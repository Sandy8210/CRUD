=> CORS :

    -> The cors package is middleware for Express that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your Node.js web application.

    -> When you're developing a web application or an API, CORS becomes crucial when your frontend (client-side code running in a web browser) needs to make requests to a backend server that's hosted on a different domain, port, or protocol.

    -> CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent malicious scripts from making unauthorized requests to another domain.

    ->  By default, web browsers enforce the same-origin policy, which means scripts loaded from one origin (domain, protocol, or port) can only make requests to the same origin by default.

    -> CORS relaxes this restriction by allowing servers to specify which origins are permitted to access their resources.

=> SCHEMA:

    -> In the context of Mongoose and MongoDB, a schema is a blueprint that defines the structure of documents within a collection.

    -> It outlines the fields, their types, validation rules, and other properties associated with the data stored in MongoDB.

        => BREAKDOWN's of SCHEMA :

            -> Field Definitions.
            -> Validation Rules.
            -> Default Values.
            -> Nested Schema.
            -> Additional options

=> RAPID API :

    -> Check url end-points, through the VS-code
    -> it's like a postman

=> moment-timezone :

    -> Time Zone Conversion.
    -> Getting Time Zone Information.
    -> Displaying Dates and Times.
